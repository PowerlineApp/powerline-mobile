# Introduction
Powerline is an open, social, streamlined mobile app and web platform that makes it easier for people to change their world through individual or collective action at the local and global levels. Think of it as Twitter/Yammer for democracy or as a community network for civil society (a.k.a. the non-profit and activist space).

Learn more through the [Detailed Overview](https://assembly.com/powerline/posts/the-detailed-overview).

## Open Source
Powerline is now open source under the AGPL license for development with the Assembly community. Powerline runs as a SaaS application – there is a free “mission” tier as well as paid upgrade plans. With the Assembly platform, all generated revenue from the product is funneled into the project and it's contributors. After subtracting hosting costs and other expenses, 10% goes to Assembly as a fee and the rest is distributed back to project contributors via Assembly based on their ownership (determined by their project contributions).

By contributing to Powerline, you’re making a difference for a fun open source project with a real world-changing mission and, unlike traditional OSS, you’re earning your fair share of the profits, too. To get started simply join us on our [Assembly Project Page](https://assembly.com/powerline).

## Branching
Our branching strategy is straightforward and well documented . For a detailed look please see [A successful Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). 

### Branches
* develop - Our main branch for all features
* master - Production ready code
* feature - Your feature branch (temporary branch)
* release-*, hotfix-* - temporary branches 


## Documentation
**Work in progress. Please help us build our documentation!**
Check out all of our documentation for more details include our API [PowerlineApp Documentation](http://powerlineapp.github.io/).

## Pull Request & Claiming your Bounty
When your code is ready and on GitHub, create a pull request via the GitHub UI. Once your pull request is created, it is best practice to go to the bounty on Assembly and submit your work with a link to the pull request. If the feature you created does not have a bounty created yet, simply create one explaining what you've done and why. The core team will award the bounty after confirming and merging the contribution. We recommend you include the appropriate unit tests to make things easier for everyone. 

After the bounty or work is submitted, add a comment to the pull request with a link to the bounty. This keeps the code review and merging process quick and easy.
